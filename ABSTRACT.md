The dataset contains 1560 leaf images with visible red mites and spots (denoting coffee leaf rust presence) for infection cases and images without such structures for healthy cases. In addition, the data set includes annotations regarding objects (leaves), state (healthy and unhealthy) and the severity of disease (leaf area with spots). Images were all obtained in real-world conditions in the same coffee plants field using a smartphone camera.
