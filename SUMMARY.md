**RoCoLe: A Robusta Coffee Leaf Images Dataset** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 1560 images with 1560 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*coffee_leaf*).

Each image in the RoCoLe dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (1560 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the [Escuela Superior Politecnica Agropecuaria de Manabi, Equador](http://www.espam.edu.ec/) and [Universidad de Santiago de Chile](https://www.usach.cl/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
