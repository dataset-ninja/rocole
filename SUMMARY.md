**RoCoLe** (A robusta coffee leaf images dataset) is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 1560 images with 1560 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*coffee_leaf*).

Each image in the RoCoLe dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 0 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (1560 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the [Escuela Superior Politecnica Agropecuaria de Manabi](http://www.espam.edu.ec/) and [Universidad de Santiago de Chile](https://www.usach.cl/).

Here is the visualized example of the single *coffee_leaf* class:
