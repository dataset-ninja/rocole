**RoCoLe: A Robusta Coffee Leaf Images Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the agricultural and biological research. 

The dataset consists of 1560 images with 2329 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *healthy*, *unhealthy*, *rust_level_1*, and other: *red_spider_mite*, *rust_level_2*, *rust_level_3*, and *rust_level_4*.

Images in the RoCoLe dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2019 by the Escuela Superior Politecnica Agropecuaria de Manabi, Equador and Universidad de Santiago de Chile.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
